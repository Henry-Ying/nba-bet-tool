# nba-bet-tool

This is a tool that estimates the chance of an NBA player prop bet succeeding and provides the moneyline that makes the bet worth making. 

This tool uses the help of basketball reference web scraper, which you can download at this link: https://jaebradley.github.io/basketball_reference_web_scraper/
If you want to go to the GitHub page to clone the repository, click the top right on that page. 

After cloning the repository, you can either move this file into the project or change the import statement to match the project's location. 

The tool only needs first name and last name, so for players like Jaren Jackson Jr. you can omit the Jr. 

Round over/under lines UP. For example, if the line is 25.5, round it to 26 and input 26.
