# nba-bet-tool

This is a tool that estimates the chance of an NBA player prop bet succeeding and provides the moneyline that makes the bet worth making. 

This tool uses the help of basketball reference web scraper: https://jaebradley.github.io/basketball_reference_web_scraper/

The tool only needs first name and last name, so for players like Jaren Jackson Jr. you can omit the Jr. 

Round over/under lines UP. For example, if the line is 25.5, round it to 26 and input 26. 

Steps for setup:

1. Download basketball reference web scraper by using pip install (instructions at link above)
2. Alternatively, you can clone the repository at the same link
